# Private Focus

Chrome extension to block websites.

Apparently all extensions that offer this functionality require you share
ridiculous amount of data or are just overly complicated.

This extension is OSS, no data collected and simply blocks websites in a list
on a shcedule so you can stayed focused and get shit done.
