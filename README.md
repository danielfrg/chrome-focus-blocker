# Private Focus

Chrome extension to block websites.
Just blocks websites in a list on a schedule so you can stayed focused and get shit done.

Apparently all extensions that offer this functionality require you share
ridiculous amount of data or are just overly complicated.

This extension simple, OSS, no data collected
